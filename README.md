# VLAN-InterVLAN-Routing
Cisco Packet Tracer VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing Lab

This project demonstrates the configuration of VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing using a Cisco router-on-a-stick topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Configuration Summary
- VLANs: 10 (HR), 20 (IT), 30 (Sales)
- Subnets:
  - VLAN 10: 192.168.10.0/24
  - VLAN 20: 192.168.20.0/24
  - VLAN 30: 192.168.30.0/24
- Router-on-a-Stick with 802.1Q encapsulation
- Switch trunk carrying VLANs 10, 20, 30
- Devices in each VLAN can communicate through the router

## Verification
- Successful ping between VLANs
- Verified VLAN and routing tables
